                <h3>Exploring the Natural Wonders of Davao Oriental</h3>

                <img src="sanv.jpg" alt="ai-image" class="float-image" />

                <p class="p-margin-left">
                    Nestled in the southeastern part of Mindanao, Davao Oriental
                    is a province blessed with breathtaking natural attractions.
                    From pristine beaches and waterfalls to lakes and sandbars,
                    Davao Oriental has a lot to offer for nature lovers and
                    outdoor enthusiasts. In this blog, we'll highlight some of
                    the top natural destinations you shouldn't miss when
                    visiting this beautiful province.
                </p>

                <h2>San Victor Island</h2>
                <p class="p-margin-left">
                    One of the most popular attractions in Davao Oriental is the
                    picturesque San Victor Island. Located off the coast of
                    Governor Generoso town, this tiny island paradise boasts
                    powdery white sand beaches and crystal clear waters perfect
                    for swimming, snorkeling, and diving. Walk along its
                    coastline shaded by coconut trees or relax on a beach swing
                    and enjoy stunning views of the sea and sky. For a bit of
                    adventure, try cliff diving into the ocean from the island's
                    rocky cliffs.
                </p>

                    src="cur.jpg"
                    alt="Second Image"
                    class="second-float-image" />

                <h2>Curtain Falls</h2>
                <p class="p-margin-left">
                    Tucked within theremote village of Marayag in Lupon town is
                    the majestic Curtain Falls. Cascading beautifully into a
                    natural pool below, this two-layered waterfall earned its
                    name from its curtain-like appearance. The journey to this
                    hidden gem involves traversing rivers and rainforests which
                    is an adventure in itself. Take a refreshing dip in its cold
                    waters or simply relax on the rocks and admire the
                    wilderness surrounding you.
                </p>

                    alt="third Image"
                    class="third-float-image" />
                <h2>Lake Carolina</h2>
                <p class="p-margin-left">
                    This stunning crater lake is located high up in the hilly
                    landscapes of San Isidro town. Formed by an ancient volcanic
                    eruption, Lake Carolina is a magnificent sight to behold
                    with its clear blue-green waters surrounded by verdant
                    forests. Walk along the lake and bask in the peaceful
                    ambience. Go on a photo hunt around the lake capturing its
                    ethereal beauty at different spots.

                    class="fourth-float-image" />
                <h2>Poo Sandbar</h2>
                <p class="p-margin-left">
                    Arguably the most iconic destination in Davao Oriental is
                    the Poo Sandbar in Governor Generoso town. This unique
                    7-kilometer long sandbar is shaped like a hook or croissant
                    which gave it the name "Poo", meaning hook in the local
                    Kamayo language. During low tide, you can walk far out along
                    the sandbar and surround yourself with the sea. Local
                    fishermen also set up picnic tents here where you can enjoy
                    a meal along with the fantastic scenery. Watching the colors
                    of the sky transform during Davao Oriental's famous sunsets
                    from Poo Sandbar is an experience like no other.
